Based on Napoleon Hill's annual self-analysis framework in *Think and Grow Rich*, "the yearly analysis should disclose a decrease in faults and an increase in virtues. One goes ahead, stands still, or goes backward in life."

1. Did I attain the goal that I established as my objective for the previous year?
2. Was I persistent in following my plans through to completion?
3. What, above all else, do I most desire?
    * Do I intend to acquire it?
        * If no, why do I most desire it?
        * If yes, am I willing to subordinate all other desires for this one?
        * How much time will I need to devote&mdash;and how much time do I actually devote&mdash;to acquiring it?
4. How can I re-budget my time and change my habits so I will be more efficient during the coming year?
5. Can I name three of my most damaging weaknesses? What am I doing to correct them?

**Negative Influences**  
"The most common weakness of all human beings is the habit of leaving their minds open to the negative influence of other people."

1. Do I have a method by which I can shield myself against the negative influence of others?
2. What connection, if any, do I see between the people with whom I associate most closely, and any unhappiness I may experience?
3. Could it be that some person I consider to be a friend is, in reality, my worst enemy because of their negative influence on my mind?
4. By what rules do I judge who is helpful and who is damaging to me?
5. Who among my acquaintances:
    * Encourages me most?
    * Cautions me most?
    * Discourages me most?

Progress isn't accidental. It's measured, reviewed, and corrected.
