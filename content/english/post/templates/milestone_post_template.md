Milestone X: <Title>
Overview
This milestone is part of the HomeLab Network Project (Version 1). This milestone focuses on implementing <high-level goal> within the HomeLab Network Project. The objective is to establish <what this enables> while reinforcing foundational networking concepts aligned with the CCNA curriculum.
This milestone builds upon the previous phase and prepares the environment for subsequent expansion.

Objectives
The objectives of this milestone are to:
    • <Objective 1>
    • <Objective 2>
    • <Objective 3>

Design Summary
The following design decisions guide this milestone:
    • <Why a particular technology or approach was selected>
    • <Constraints imposed by hardware or scope>
    • <Tradeoffs intentionally accepted>

Implementation Details
Key implementation steps include:
    • <Configuration summary>
    • <VLANs, routing, services, etc.>
    • <Relevant technologies used>
Where applicable, the physical lab configuration is mirrored in Cisco Packet Tracer to validate behavior and support documentation.

Validation & Testing
The following checks were performed to validate this milestone:
    • <Connectivity tests>
    • <Service verification>
    • <Expected outcomes>

Observations & Lessons Learned
This milestone reinforces the following concepts:
    • <Technical takeaway>
    • <Design insight>
    • <What would be done differently in a future iteration>

Artifacts
    • Logical topology diagram
    • Relevant configuration snippets
    • Cisco Packet Tracer file (if applicable)
