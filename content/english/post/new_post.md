Yearly Analysis
“The yearly analysis should disclose a decrease in faults and an increase in virtues. One goes ahead, stands still, or goes backward in life.”

1. Have I attained the goal that I established as my objective for this year?
2. Have I been persistent in following my plans through to completion?
3. How may I re-budget my time and change my habits so I will be more efficient during the coming year?

Negative Influences
“The most common weakness of all human beings is the habit of leaving their minds open to the negative influence of other people.

1. Have I a method by which I can shield myself against the negative influence of others?
2. Can I name three of my most damaging weaknesses? What am I doing to correct them?
3. What connection, if any, do I see between the people with whom I associate most closely, and any unhappiness I may experience?
4. Could it be that some person I consider to be a friend is, in reality, my worst enemy because of their negative influence on my mind?
5. By what rules do I judge who is helpful and who is damaging to me?
6. Who among my acquaintances
    * encourages me most?
    * Cautions me most?
    * Discourages me most?
    * Helps me most in other ways?
7. What, above all else, do I most desire? Do I intend to acquire it? Am I willing to subordinate all other desires for this one? How much time daily do I devote to acquiring it?
