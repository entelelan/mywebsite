# Welcome to EnteleLAN – Documenting the Journey to Layer 7 and Beyond
**EnteleLAN** is a domain for learning and growth—a personal network of tools, tutorials, and reflections. The goal of this site is to document what I learn, build, and experience in the world of IT.

The name comes from the Greek concept of entelecheia—the realization or fulfillment of potential. In that spirit, this site may occasionally branch into other passions such as fitness, cooking, baking, or gardening.

Still, the core focus remains technical: sharing my journey in IT, documenting real-world learning, and providing resources you might find useful. If you do, please consider sharing the content on your preferred social platform(s).

At EnteleLAN, learning never stops. Join me as I explore technology, tools, and ideas—from the physical layer all the way to Layer 7 and beyond.

# Networks Are Stories. This Is Mine.
My name is Moises, and I'm a Network Engineer for an Internet Service Provider (ISP). I’m passionate about empowering others by sharing knowledge and resources that support the sincere and honest development of one's potential—and this site is the product of that passion.

My interest in technology began as a young child and grew into a love for all things IT. I was that curious kid who always asked, “But why?” (yes, that kid—lol). I became the IT guy at home, fixing our dial-up and DSL connections, installing and troubleshooting printers, and solving technical issues before I fully understood what IT even was. That curiosity evolved into a deep appreciation for critical thinking and problem-solving. I’ve always enjoyed learning how to think through problems—and that’s what I find in the world of IT.

After high school, I attended college and earned a Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Studies with a concentration in Cisco Networking Systems. However, upon graduation, I struggled to find a job, so I pivoted and joined the military.

I’m a proud United States Navy veteran. I served as a Yeoman and achieved the rank of Petty Officer First Class (E-6), equivalent to a Staff Sergeant in the Army or Marine Corps, and a Technical Sergeant in the Air Force.

>&mdash; President John F. Kennedy*

After my military service, a few years into civilian life, I pursued technical certifications in hopes of breaking into the world of IT. I earned the Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician (CCENT) certification, and shortly after, landed a seasonal tech support role at an income tax preparation provider. That experience led to a position at a Managed Service Provider (MSP), and eventually to my current role at an ISP, where I’ve progressed from Technical Support to Team Lead, and now, Network Engineer.

I know how overwhelming the world of IT can feel—there’s so much information out there. Which course should you take? Which simulator or emulator should you use? What certification is worth your time? If I could offer one piece of advice as you advance on your own technical journey, it would be this:

> Ask yourself: *Am I doing this because I want to—or because I feel like I have to?*

It’s easy to fall into the trap of doing things out of obligation—because of social expectations, pressure from others, or habit. But taking the time to reflect on whether your actions align with your goals can lead to a far more fulfilling life and career.

I'm always learning something new-whether it's to sharpen my skills or explore new areas of interest. Right now, I'm focusing on:
- JNCIA-Junos (JN0-105) - Juniper Networks Associate
- Cisco DevNet Associate (200-901) - Network automation and software development
- PCEP - Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer
- CCNP Enterprise (350-401 ENCOR)
- Cisco Enterprise Advanced Routing and Services (300-410 ENARSI)

You'll likely see content related to these topics pop up in the near future.
